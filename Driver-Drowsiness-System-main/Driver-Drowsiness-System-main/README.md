# Driver-Drowsiness-System
The system proposed focus on reducing the chances of vehicular collision due to 
drowsiness. Insufficient sleep has an impact upon a human's capacity to perform 
regular daily activities. Drowsiness has emerged as the most common reason of
many accidents and crashes al across the world. Many researchers have 
concluded that many of the crashes involved drowsiness of the driver and 
insufficient sleep. Highways are the places where these type of crashes occurs the 
most. The study intends to reduce overall number of collisions brought on by 
driver's weariness and sleepiness. With the help of drowsiness recognition 
software, collisions can be avoided and also lives can be saved while individuals 
are beginning to nod off. The proposed method detects the real time face and eye 
movement recognition. Geometric method is used to calculate the eye opening
and closing.
